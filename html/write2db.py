## Python app to accept data from one of several HTML form submissions and write 
##    the data to a database. 
##
## --Should check which HTML page has invoked it (if possible)
## --Should check data prior to writing to the database
##      -database is strict about data types being entered?
##      -some santiy checking of the data being submitted is a good idea.
## -- Should fail if executed directly or not launched by one of the HTML pages.
## -- It's ok for this to be highly insecure, it will be useful to break it later.
